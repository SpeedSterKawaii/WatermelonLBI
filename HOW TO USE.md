- Step 1: Download the Project from https://github.com/SpeedSterKawaii/WatermelonLBI/
- Step 2: Use Win.RAR or any Tool to Extract the Package (7Zip,Filmora,SE,WinRAR).
- Step 3: Open WatermelonLBI.sln, if a .dll is in any of the folders, please delete it.
- Step 4: Open DllMain.cpp, and modify the strings and messages if you would like to.
- Step 5: Open Roblox.hpp and update all of the addresses, calling conventions, offsets.
- Step 6: Update the ScriptC0ntext offset, Roblox Lua state and Gettop (top and base).
- Step 7: Optional: if you want a custom identity msg, update the identity integers as well.
- Step 8: Goto Settings.hpp and turn off AUTO_UPDATE since it doesn't currently work right now.
- Step 9: (if it errors, just set to NULL so it will just return 0.)
- Step 10: If the message box displays as "Returned NULL", please erase any defines that use 0.
- Step 11: Change your pipe name, or your fake pipe name. An optional "anti pipe" is as well.

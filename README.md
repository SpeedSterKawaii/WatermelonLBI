# WatermelonLBI

Watermelon Bytecode Interperter, Executes **Lua Scripts** as fast as an blink of an eye.

# What is this?

I've decided to *leak* this **LBI**, off my old exploit called Melon, just renamed to *watermelon*.
It might or might not work because some memory addresses are outdated so please, **update** them.

# Features?
- VS2019 Project
- LBI DLL Source
- 2/4 Lua Functions
- Outstanding Execution
- Loadstring/HttpGet
- Internal Luau Executor

# What it uses?
- 6 offsets (deserializer, getfield, pushstring, pcall, pushboolean, spawn)
- 3 functions (getgenv, getfenv, loadstring(and httpget as written))

# Why is there a watermark?

We put a lot of *work* into our LBI, so we decided to insert a *watermark* inside of the *dll*, it is currently unremovable but you can pay us via **Discord Nitro or Robux**. 
And no, PayPal isn't supported *yet*. You may attempt to remove the watermark, as it is useless to even **attempt** to try.
